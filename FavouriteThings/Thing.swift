This photo was taken at one of my favorite races in the Owen sound area.

   I was introduced to cross country skiing at a young age by my parents who are cross country skiers.I started racing two years ago and it has led me to a lot.  I have been to BC for a XC skiing trip with LCS and I was on a TV show called all round champion because of this sport.  It is also part of the reason that I chose to come to LCS.

Bentley although he is 6 still acts like a puppy,  always playfull, full of energy, but he sleeps a lot.  He is a cockapoo (cocker spaniel and poodle mix). He has a lot of attitude, I think that my brother would harass him when he was sleeping and now every time someone touches him when he is resting he will growl or snap at them but he never bites."),
