Eventually I started to win, and I started to like running(that wasn't until about 7th grade).  Then I got really interested in running and started to run on my own until eventually I became to fast for my father and the only person in the family that could keep up with me was my dog.  Even though I started to enjoy running in 7th grade I never really got competitive until this past summer where I was running 60km+ a week which led to injury.  It's a shame there weren't any races this summer because I think I would have done well. "),

I quickly got back to better shape and felt ready for a race just in time for the Ondatje challenge the school was holding virtually (due to covid).  I have competed in triathlons and done quite a bit of paddling expeditions so I felt comfortable with all of the sports.  I did all of the events under the minimum time expectation (which means I got the medal) and in doing so ran my fastest 10km of 38:59min."),
